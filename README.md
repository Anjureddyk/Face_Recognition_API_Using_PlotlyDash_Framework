This simple API created using PlotlyDash framework sets up a web interface where users can upload an image from there local disk, and the application detects faces in the image using OpenCV's Haar cascade classifier. The resulting image with bounding boxes around the faces is displayed, along with the number of faces detected.


The code sets up a Dash application with a layout consisting of an HTML structure defined using Dash HTML components (dash_html_components) and Dash core components (dash_core_components).

The layout includes an H1 heading, an upload button to select an image, an output image element, and a div to display the result (number of detected faces).

The detect_faces function uses the OpenCV library (cv2) and a pre-trained Haar cascade classifier (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml) to detect faces in the provided image. It draws rectangles around the detected faces and saves the resulting image as result.jpg. The function returns the path of the result image and the number of faces detected.

The update_output function is a callback function triggered when an image is uploaded. It decodes the uploaded image, saves it to a file, calls the detect_faces function to process the image and obtain the result, and encodes the result image as a base64 string. The function returns the base64 encoded result image and the number of faces detected as output.

The app.callback decorator connects the update_output function to the Dash application, specifying the input (the uploaded image) and the outputs (the displayed image and the result text).
