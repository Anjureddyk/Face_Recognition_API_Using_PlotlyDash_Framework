# Face_Recognition_API_Using_PlotlyDash_Framework
This simple API created using PlotlyDash framework sets up a web interface where users can upload an image from there local disk, and the application detects faces in the image using OpenCV's Haar cascade classifier. The resulting image with bounding boxes around the faces is displayed, along with the number of faces detected.
